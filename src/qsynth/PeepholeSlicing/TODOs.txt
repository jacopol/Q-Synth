- Add Cnot Synthesis as part of Peephole Optimization

- Compare Clifford Simplication in tket with our Peephole optimization

- Double Excitation Operator CNOT reduction
  - Replace tket clifford simplication with our optimziation to compute CNOT minimization
  - Perhaps using permutations can result in 12 CNOTs (may be not)
